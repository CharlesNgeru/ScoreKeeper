#Basic Score Keeping Game Web Application

## Motivation
I made this project while I was learning Javascript.

## Tech/framework used
Ex. - HTML, CSS, JS.


<b>Built with</b>
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com)

## Features
The Application can be used for offline purposes since the libraries are sited offline

## Installation
Just open/run the index.html in your browser by double clicking it or right-clicking then choose open with your browser. It is as easy as that!!

## How to use?
This is a basic score keeping web-app.

You can input the number of games to be played in the input box. This will decide for how long the counter keeps going, for example, the default counter is set at 5 this means the first player either player one or player two to get a score of 5 the game automatically ends and a green color is added to the winning score to represent the end of the game. Hence the counter stops and no more scores can be added until it is reset or a new game is started.
